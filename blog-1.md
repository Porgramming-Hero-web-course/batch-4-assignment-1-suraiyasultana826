# Union Types
Imagine a box that can hold either a ball or a cube. This is like a union type in TypeScript. It can be one thing or another.

# Intersection Types
Now, imagine a robot that can both walk and talk. It has the abilities of both a walker and a talker. This is like an intersection type. It must have the qualities of both.

# Why Are They Useful?

- Flexibility: You can create variables that can hold different types of values.
- Type Safety: The computer can check if you're using the right type of value.
- Readability: Your code becomes easier to understand.
  
By using these types, you can write cleaner and more reliable TypeScript code.
